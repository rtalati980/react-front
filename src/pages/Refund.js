        At Radha Krishna Mart, we strive to ensure that our customers are completely satisfied with their purchases. However, we understand that sometimes things don't work out as expected, and you may need to return a product. We have established a comprehensive refund policy to facilitate a smooth and hassle-free return process for our valued customers.

If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, you may return the product within 14 days of receiving it. To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging. Please include the receipt or proof of purchase with your return to expedite the process.

Once we receive your returned item, our team will inspect it to ensure it meets the return criteria. If the item is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment within 3 business days. Please note that it may take some additional time for the refund to reflect in your account, depending on your bank or credit card issuer.

If the returned product does not meet the return criteria, we will notify you and return the item to you at your expense. Radha Krishna Mart reserves the right to refuse a refund if the product shows signs of use, damage, or alteration.

In the case of defective or damaged products, please contact our customer service team within 48 hours of receiving the item. We will arrange for a replacement or a full refund, including any shipping costs incurred.

For any further assistance with returns or refunds, our customer service team is always here to help. You can reach us via email or phone, and we will do our best to resolve any issues promptly.

At Radha Krishna Mart, your satisfaction is our priority. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to our refund policy, which enables us to provide you with the best possible service. Thank you for shopping with us.
